###Welcome to Pioneer

Pioneer is a simple little build kit that can be used for building local PHP environments on Ubuntu 14.  The environment is built using Ansible playbooks which keeps all commands and configurations simple and easy.  Pioneer can be used to create remote servers that mirror the local development environment and deployed with a single command.
